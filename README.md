## Kopytko



Project i'm currently working at.
It's page for "Kopytko" restaurant, where you can browse and order food, and book the table.
All orders and booking are sent using firebase. 
In "kopytko-employers" I have a project where all of that data is managed by employers.
They can delete, confirm and see everythinng what customers has send them, also reply to messages.
