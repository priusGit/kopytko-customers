live: kopytko-priusgit.netlify.app

Project i'm currently working at.

It's page for "Kopytko" restaurant, where you can browse and order food, and book the table.
All orders and booking are sent using firebase. 
In close future I ll create "kopytko-employers" where all of that data will be managed by employers.
They will have options to delete, confirm orders, cheit their status and see everything what customers has send them, also reply to messages.
